  In last year of B.Tech I made a Library Management System project. In this project, students can check if the book they want is available in libraray or not and how many copies are there before going to library. Librarian can also check which student has taken which book and who has returned the book and who not. Libraraian can also check if the stock of that book is there in libraray or not.
